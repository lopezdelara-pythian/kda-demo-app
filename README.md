# Data Streaming with Kafka and Flink on AWS

This repo contains the code for the data streaming application described in the blog post [Data Streaming with Kafka and Flink on AWS - Part 2](https://blog.pythian.com/data-streaming-with-kafka-and-flink-on-aws-part-2/). The blog post series explores the capabilities and limitations of AWS managed versions of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) by deploying a simple streaming application that consumes simulated book purchase events and computes the aggregated sales per bookstore per minute. [Part 1](https://blog.pythian.com/data-streaming-with-kafka-and-flink-on-aws-part-1/) explores the deployment of an Apache Kafka cluster and Apache Kafka Connect data generator on [Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/). Part 2, on the other hand, explores the deployment of the data streaming app on [Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics (KDA)](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/).
